		<h1>
			Qt SDK Repo Chooser
		</h1>
		<p>
			If you are using the online <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">Qt 5 SDK</a>
			but downloads are slow and/or you frequently get disconnected, this tool might help.
			You might have been assigned a mirror that is performing poorly. The Qt SDK Repo
			Chooser helps you select a non-default mirror, which might give you a better download
			experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ideally, the causes of this issue should be solved upstream. Please add your thoughts,
			ideas, and votes to the reports at <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTIFW-5">QTIFW-5</a>
			and <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTIFW-441">QTIFW-441</a>. In the meantime
			though, I hope this tool is useful for you to get started with Qt.
		</p>

			Usage Instructions
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Go to <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/</a>
				and click "<b>View All Downloads</b>".
				<p><img src="1_view.png"/></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Choose a random file and click "<b>(Info)</b>". At this stage, it doesn't matter
				which file you choose; we simply want to check the servers' download speeds.
				<p><img src="2_info.png"/></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Choose a mirror and download the file. Keep an eye on your download speed for about
				15 seconds. If you are satisfied with the download speed, cancel the download and
				go to step #4. Otherwise, try another mirror.

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Under the "Repositories" tab, deselect "<b>Qt <platform> online root
				repository</b>". (Note: If you already have an existing installation, there will be
				other repositories listed. Don't deselect these)</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Add</b> a User Defined Repository. Paste the URL from step #6.
				<p><img src="9_final.png"/></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Download Qt. Happy coding!
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b>IMPORTANT!</b>: When a new version of Qt is released, you will need to re-run steps
			#5 and #6 in the Qt SDK Repo Chooser to update your local repo with details of the new
			packages.
